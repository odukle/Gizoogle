# Gizoogle

A few years back while browsing the web I stumbled upon this website called Gizoogle (I guess most of you might be aware of it already) which converts normal English sentences into gangsta slang. The site is apparently an homage to Snoop Dogg.
I found the translations so hilarious and scoured through play store to find if there’s any app like that on it. But I couldn’t find one. I was always interested in android development and few months back I did an online course on Kotlin and Android studio and decided to make the app myself and this is what I came up with,

here is the link to the app on playstore - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.odukle.gizoogle
